    m "Yes, yes.  Of course.  How stupid of me to not suggest it from the start.  "
    m "Here, Miss Granger.  Take your wand handle and put it between your legs..."
    her "Be--between my legs?"
    m "Yes, yes.  That should work as well as the other.  The proximity is quite close."

    m "Oh, yes.  But that was an excellent first attempt.  You should be very proud of the way you have performed tonight.  "

    m "Please do not try to bait me into awarding more points for something that benefits you alone!"
    her "I'm sorry, sir.  I really need to find a way to help Gryffindor get more points.  The Slytherins are cheating and may win the House Cup!"
    m "Regardless of that, you must continue to work on retrieving your magic at all costs.  Any time you have a free moment you need to work on it.  "
    m "Perhaps late at night before you go to sleep, or in the mornings at your bath.  Or if you find you cannot sleep."
    m "When you take a break in the library, or are reading in class."
    her "I think I can manage to do that..."
    m "But I warn you, every time you use your wand to do magic in class or elsewhere some of your essence will leach back into it."
    m "You will need to be diligent in retrieving it afterwards so you do not get behind again!"
    m "Once we have built your innate magic back to a usable level I can help you learn to move beyond the wand, so to speak!"
    her "Oh, Professor!  Thank you so much!  I will work very hard to get my magic back from my wand!  "
    her "And to think all this time I was actually making things worse by practising magic so much!  "
    m "You may want to cut back on that until you can retrieve more of your essence."
    her "That will affect my grades, I'm sure.  But I will do it!  I don't want to go back to living as a muggle!"
    her "Um, Professor, can I still come by for lessons, or just to talk to you?  I want to be ready for when I no longer need my wand to do magic."
    m "Of course, my dear.  Feel free to come as often as you like!  Now, I have some work to do and you need to be off to bed."
    her "Yes, sir.  And I promise you I will be retrieving more of my magic when I get back to my room!"
    m "Oh, and Miss Granger?"
    her "Yes, Professor?"
    m "I think you should re-enroll in the Divination class.  Professor Treelawn can help you learn to read auras so you will know how much magic you have restored."
    her "It's Professor Trelawney, sir.  And Divination is during the time I spend in the library each day catching up on my other classwork!"
    m "If you want to continue to recover your powers you will need the skills she can teach you."
    m "I can think of no other teacher here who would be more qualified.  But do not worry."
    m "I will write a note to her asking her to let you into her class and to give you a little extra time to catch up on the assignments you have missed."
    her "All right.  I will try to get her work done on top of everything else I have in my {i}real{/i} classes.  And without my study period, too."
    m "Very good, Miss Granger.  I'm sure you will be right as rain before you know it."
