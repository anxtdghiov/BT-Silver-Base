#LUNA PLOT
#Luna is misinterpreting her own teenage arousal as a result of a group of wrackspurts that have decided to terrorise her.
#Genie is able to determine the true cause of her arousal and informs her that they only cure for her arousal is to perform certain activites together


#Don't forget to incorporate the quibbler

#LUNA MECHANICS
#Functions on a different mechanic from hermione. She still has a 'whoring' stat but instead of anger she has arousal
#Certain activities will cause Luna to gain arousal and others will cause her to lose it
#Any favors that focus on her will lose arousal as she will achieve a 'release'
#Any favors that focus on genie will cause her to gain arousal
#If her arousal is too high she won't do the genie favors and conversely if it is too low then she will not do the favors that focus on her
